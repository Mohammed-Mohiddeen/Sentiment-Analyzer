# Sentiment-Analyzer
A Machine learning Approach on Twitter Dataset
It focuses on developing a robust sentiment analysis model capable of classifying tweets into positive or negative categories. Social media platforms like Twitter have become critical arenas for public discourse, where opinions on various topics are shared in real-time. As such, the ability to automatically analyze and interpret these opinions is invaluable for businesses, governments, and researchers alike. The main objective of this project is to harness Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to effectively gauge the sentiment expressed in tweets, providing actionable insights from large volumes of unstructured data. The dataset used in this study comprises thousands of tweets, each labeled with a sentiment, presenting a mix of text, special characters, and links. The raw data underwent extensive preprocessing to remove noise, including stop-word removal, tokenization, and stemming. These steps are crucial to standardizing the text data, making it suitable for further analysis. By converting the cleaned text into numerical features using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, we ensured that the model could effectively learn patterns indicative of different sentiments. The Classifier was chosen for this project due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling text classification tasks. The model was trained on the preprocessed data and then evaluated using a separate test dataset. The choice of Naive Bayes was driven by its ability to deliver strong performance in scenarios where the assumption of feature independence while not entirely accurate leads to efficient and reliable classification. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 78%, indicating its competence in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments in tweets. The results of this project demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of providing accurate sentiment analysis with reasonable computational efficiency. The modelâ€™s performance suggests that it can be a useful tool for real-time sentiment analysis
